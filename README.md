## Zero-Inflated Gamma probabilistic model

This code implements the Zero-Inflated Gamma encoding and decoding model for post-deconvolved calcium imaging traces.

## Tutorial

A Jupyter Notebook tutorial is available in the code directory. There're more examples in the examples in paper directory.

## Installation

The code is written in Python 3.6. In addition to standard scientific Python libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib), the code expects: Tensorflow (>=1.9.0)
